## Overview
Installation of NPM PostgreSQL package in server.js . Located UName and password for both Windows and Mac users to connect functioning code and data base to server for real-time updating when server is up and running. Changed articleView to removed any JSON exports. Finished SQL query to update and delete articles. Studied each new route and commented where answers wherever prompted.

## Getting Started
- ensure that you read the README.md made by Code Fellows to install and understand what needs to be installed in order for this to work
- start up your server after you have cd'ed into our file and opened up our index.html and new.html
- have some fun typing articles and having them turn up in both the database and be shown in the index.html filters and the page itself.

## Architecture
HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, SQL, jQuery, various NPM packages functions, node, PSQL server language, handlebars, AJAX, and various other library functions if I am forgetting any.
